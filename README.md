# Caesar-Box-Cipher
Encrypt and/or Decrypt the text using Caesar Box Cipher.

This program acts as a tool to encrypt or decrypt using Caesar's Box method.

With the help of Step count in 'for' loop the Box Cipher is implemented.
It can also be done by using the module Numpy where matrices can be created and the process would be made easy.
